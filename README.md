Below is the framework breakdown and a description of each file/directory.
Also has directions for launching locally.


## Local Development

- Optionally you can create a separate environment to install and launch locally.
- Make sure all database credentials are in a file named `db.csv` but please don't deploy this file to a server.

pip install -r requirements.txt
python application.py
```
